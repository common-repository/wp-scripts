This is designed to help you insert the prototype or mootools framework into your wordpress blog.

== Description ==

You might ask, why do I need help inserting the prototype or mootools frameworks into my blog. You don't really, but this plugin kinda taks the hassle out of editing all the neccessary files, and it also includes a few extra scripts to ease your javascript pain.

At the moment all you get it prototype, this framwork also allows you to use Scriptaculous. You can select the individual element you want to apply, or just switch the whole thing on. Both frameworks come with lightbox. There is more to come, but I need some feedback/suggestions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of the ZIP file to '/wp-content/plugins/'
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Options' and click on 'WP-Scripts' to configure
4. That's it!!
5. If you want to use lightbox, just ad 'rel="lightbox"' to the <A HREF> tag
